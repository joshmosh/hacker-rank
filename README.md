# Hacker Rank

Showcase for the work I have completed online at [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com). This repository will be a mix of languages and solutions. All solutions in this repository can be run through my [profile page](https://www.hackerrank.com/joshminnich) on Hacker Rank.

## Notes

These scripts can be run locally as well. But I won't be providing any instructions for doing so. This repository is just a mirror of what I've completed online and wish to archive.

Thanks!
